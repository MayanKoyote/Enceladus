# POPSLoader
An open source Launcher for POPStarter scripted in lua.

Based on [Enceladus](https://github.com/DanielSant0s/Enceladus)

## Usage
move the POPSLOADER.ELF and the `POPSLDR/` folder into a USB device or internal HDD

### Tips
- (USB Only) if you want POPStarter IGR to go back to POPSLoader automatically, pasthe the `POPSLDR/` folder into the USB root, and copy the `POPSLOADER.ELF` renamed as `BOOT.ELF`
- you can replace the POPStarter IGR textures with custom ones that looks like stock POPSLoader UI by pasting the `PATCH_5.BIN` found inside the `POPSLDR/` into the `POPS/` folder
